# Doctor-Channelling-and-Patient-LifeCycle-Management-System
1)	Project Background 
In the modern day society medical services play a prominent role and is in high demand. With this high demand doctors are on tight schedules in visiting patients at various hospitals and channeling centers alike and therefore is in requirement of managing the allocated time at each medical institution. As a result the patient’s only get a very limited space in visiting there preferred doctors at their preferred channeling centers. And therefore the patients fail to visit the relevant/preferred doctor timely in most cases.

While many urban and major cities/districts have new systems developed to overcome such shortcomings, most channeling centers in rural areas still tend to follow traditional manual systems or similar inconvenient solutions. Therefore it is vital to introduce a simplified system that enhances the communication between the doctors and the patients.

E-Channel Assistant is an Online Channeling software aimed towards functioning as such a system as aforementioned. The system facilitates a comprehensive solution to overcome the hassle of making appointments at channeling centers. It provides patients with the ability to make an appointment from anywhere from a preferred devices that has internet connectivity.

The project will ultimately deliver a fully functional online patient channeling system which will allow the users to make appointments to their preferred doctors available at the channeling center during the time slots in which those relevant doctors are available. 

The system will also allow doctors to arrange special appointments with patients if required in situations such as Surgeries, Scans etc. The system will allow the receptionist to confirm appointments on arrival of the patient at the scheduled time.

The system will allow to keep track of each patient’s medical history of their visits to the channeling center for appointments under the patients consent. This is in order to provide the doctors with a clear view of the patients’ medical history which will ultimately help doctors in making more accurate assumptions of a patient’s illness and relevant treatments to be provided.

2).Functional requirements


•	Registering of New Patients
The system should allow new patients to be registered into the system. This process
Will generate a unique id for the patient which will be used to record and keep track of information such as patient’s medical history etc.

•	View Channel Times
The system should display patients a list of doctors with the time that they are available for channeling.The patient can then select their preferred doctor along with the time convenient for them. The system will then generate a queue number for the patient with relevance to the time and the doctor.The patients have the ability to cancel a channel they have already made 2 days prior to the channel date.

•	Add/Remove Channeling Times
The doctors should be able to cancel/or reschedule there time slot if necessary to an available alternative time slot. Patients who have added a channel on a canceled time slot should be automatically informed of the cancellation via e-mail. The doctors can set a limit to the number of patients that are allowed to channel within a specific time slot allocated for them. The doctors should be able to add special channeling sessions for events such as surgeries of patients.

•	Verify Channels and Make Special Announcements
The receptionist should be able to check and verify channels made by patients and the system should generate a printable receipt of the channel. He/she shall be able to make special announcements to patients via e-mail.

•	Making Records of Patients Medical History
The doctors should be able to keep a small description/report of the patient’s medical condition given that the patient have channeled the relevant doctor recently.

•	Send messages to the patient
The patient will receive message when their channeling confirmed. 



3) Non-Functional requirements

The system shall be immune from any form of attacks to stored data. The stored details of patients and doctors alike shall not be accessed by third party under any circumstance.
•	The system shall be responsive. And must be compatible with any range of devices with internet access.
•	The system shall be user-friendly. The users shall be able to grasp the usage of the system with less amount of training or expertise.


4) User Roles and User Levels 
•	Patient
Patients are the key focus of the entire system. The patients have the ability to view Doctors along with the time slots that each doctor is available and must be able to put a channel on that time slot if the queue for that time slot is not full. The patient have the ability to cancel a channel he have already made before 2 days of the channel date. Patients can view their medical life cycle such as pressure level and sugar variation by graphs. The patient must be informed of any channeling sessions canceled by the doctor via  E-mail and SMS.
•	Doctor
The doctors have the ability to add or alter their channeling sessions to a free time slot within work hours or cancel a channeling session. They will be provided with an Interface to record patient’s medical condition during or within 2 days of a patients Visit. The doctors have the ability to allocate a special channeling session for special Events such as surgeries or scans of patients. Doctor able to analyses the patient’s Medical history for any special reasons.
•	Receptionist
Receptionist has the ability to perform tasks such as verifying channels and printing Receipts. He/she will have the ability to e-mail or send SMS to patients for any special enouncements or important messages.
•	System Administrator
The system administrator has the ability to access all aspects of the system and the Database in order to repel any errors or mistakes made by any one of the  
Fore-mentioned user roles. The system administrator is responsible for protection of any sensitive information stored in the system and must agree to a legal agreement which prevent him/her from revealing any such information under any circumstance.


5) Methodology
The system will be developed using Iterative Development approach as the Scope and the span of the system is limited and has fewer iterations to be completed. An initial prototype will be developed to be presented to the client and get a better understanding of the requirements through their feedback. The prototype may include core features such as patient registration, channeling doctors and allowing Doctors to add/change time slots. 

After testing the initial prototype and identifying the real requirements of the potential
Client the prototype will be refactored and proper functionality will be implemented. This will consist of all the requirements mentioned in section 2(requirements) with Modifications to suit the client’s real requirements.
